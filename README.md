# camp-express

This project implements a web service backend for mobile apps for camp users.
Admins can update camp information through a web service interface and mobile
apps pull the information through a similar web service interface. The goal is
to allow non-technical users to easily update the content of the mobile app
through a web interface. The mobile app is being developed as another open
source project.

We will use full-stack JavaScript development and more specifically Express for
web server, MongoDB for database, and React for web client.
